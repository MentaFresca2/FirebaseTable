First, you will need a Firebase account with a Firebase Realtime Database.

How to use:

1. Perform an "npm install."
2. Place your database credentials (API key, URL, etc.) in the dbconfig.json file.
3. Open the index.html file and enjoy! (If you are using Windows, you may not be able to open the index directly as it will not work. Try running 'npm run dev' instead.)
